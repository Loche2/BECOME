Code repository of the CIKM '26 paper "Budget and Frequency Controlled Cost-Aware Model Extraction Attack on Sequential Recommenders"

## Introduction

<img src=visualize/framework.jpg>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Budget and Frequency Controlled Cost-Aware Model Extraction Attack (BECOME), for extracting black-box sequential recommenders, which extends the standard extraction framework with two cost-aware innovations: Feedback-Driven Dynamic Budgeting period-ically evaluates the victim model to refine query allocation and steer sequence generation adaptively. Rank-Aware Frequency Controlling integrates frequency constraints with ranking guidance in the next-item sampler to select high-value items and broaden information coverage.

## Requirements

see requirements.txt

## Usage
### 1. Train the Black-Box Recommender Model

```bash
python train.py
```

Trained black-box recommenders are stored under ./experiments/model-code/dataset-code/models/best_acc_model.pth

### 2. Extract trained Black-Box Recommender model

```bash
python distill.py
```

Extracted surrogate models and metrics are stored under ./experiments/distillation_rank/distillation-specification/dataset-code/
